Advent of Code 2019 - Day 10: Monitoring Station


Find the point that has a clear line of sight the the maximum
other number of points in a grid.

Possible solutions:

- Find all lines to other points and ignore duplicates
- Find all bearings to other points and ignore duplicates

We want a list of tuples where each tuple contains the x and y
coords of the aseroid at that point.
